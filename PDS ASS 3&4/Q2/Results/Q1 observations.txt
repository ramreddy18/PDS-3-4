Remarks regarding the statistical comparison:

1. The population mean and maximum values, as far as I can tell, are higher than the sample mean and maximum.


2. I noticed that the sample percentile number is lower than the population percentile.

3. Additionally, there doesn't appear to be much of a difference between bootstrap and population statistics.
